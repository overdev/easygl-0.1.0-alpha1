# easygl #

`easygl` was designed to make easier the rendering with OpenGL. This goal is
acomplished by simplifying the necessary steps to get everything up and running.
`easygl` comes with a set of draw functions similar to those in PyGame's draw
module, so you won't have to make all on your own. But it helps you out with
creating your own geometries, shaders and VAOs.
